- Linking the JavaScript in the  bottom of the body section of the page. 

CSS:
- General styling of the page such as font family and colour of buttons.
- Inclusion of flex box properties to align the question and answer sections to the center of the page.
- Hiding elements of the page initially to be shown later on the page through Javascript. 

Javascript:
- Writing of variables including query selectors for buttons, timer elements and highscore elements.
- Writing of question array. 
- Developing functions such as starting the quiz, starting the timer, cycling the question, checking the answer, adding/logging/showing the score and clearing the score.
